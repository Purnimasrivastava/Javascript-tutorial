# JavaScript Tutorial: Daily Code Journey

**Welcome!**

This repository is designed to guide you through the exciting world of JavaScript, one code snippet at a time. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refine your skills, you'll find valuable lessons and exercises to solidify your understanding.

**Structure**

- **Daily Code Episodes:** Each day, a new folder will be added. Folder will contain a code snippet (e.g., `01_variables.js`), an explanation file (`01_variables.md`), and optionally, a challenge file (`01_variables_challenge.js`).
- **Topics:** As the tutorial progresses, folders for broader topics within JavaScript might be created (e.g., `functions`, `loops`, `dom-manipulation`). These folders will encompass relevant daily code episodes.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is recommended, but not mandatory.
2. **Code Editor:** Choose a code editor you're comfortable with, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
3. **Run the Code:**
    - For basic JavaScript execution, you can use your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12). Copy and paste the code into the console and press Enter.
    - Alternatively, create HTML files with `<script>` tags to embed the JavaScript code and view the results in your browser.

**Daily Code Episodes**

Each daily code episode will follow a standard format:

- **Code Snippet:** The main JavaScript code (`*.js` file) demonstrates a specific concept.
- **Explanation File:** The corresponding Markdown file (`*.md`) provides a clear explanation of the code, including comments within the code itself.
- **Optional Challenge File:** Some episodes might include a challenge (`*.js` file) to test your comprehension. Feel free to tackle these challenges to solidify your understanding.

**Contributions**
